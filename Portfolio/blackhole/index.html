                <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
                This project was completed as part of a final for the "Black Holes" course at University of Colorado, Boulder taught by Professor Ann-Marie Madigan.
                This simulation is not physically accurate was created to illustrate the effects of gravitational lensing and how accretion disks behave around a blackhole.
                As a project for communicating characteristics of blackholes and their science, I've also attached the brief report of this project below.
                <br><br>
                Blackholes, mysterious and daunting, are quite incredible cosmic objects of various sizes
                throughout the universe and of immense size in every galaxy. These bodies are so massive and
                dense that the gravitational pull they exert even bends light. This phenomenon gives blackholes
                their key characteristic, in that they are dark due to light not even being able to escape past the
                blackhole surface known as the event horizon. Yet, beyond that horizon immense gravity is still
                present around the blackhole and will bend light rays showcasing a lensing effect.
                <br><br>
                From our perspective the area immediately surrounding the blackhole has the most
                significant distortion which bends along the curvature of its surface. From this nature we are then
                capable of seeing what is behind the blackhole, including the occluded section of its accretion
                disk, which notably bubbles over the top. In actuality the accretion disks, made of highly
                energetic gas (plasma), are disk shaped and rotate around the blackhole maintaining angular
                momentum. The scale of accretion disks is variable and not
                all blackholes may contain one, making them that much harder to spot. Although the lensing
                effect may still be utilized to detect these bodies, since the way in which black holes bend light
                symmetrically will increase luminosity of blocked stars.

                <h1 id="breakdown">Breakdown</h1>
                I've attached a breakdown here for anyone else wishing to create their own supermassive blackhole effect.
                Although, this is just one of the ways for making blackholes in Blender - there are many different approaches.
                <br><br>
                <h2 id="hole">BlackHole</h2>
                First we want seemingly 'accurate' light-bending or 'gravitational-lensing' from our blackhole. 
                A common approach I've seen outside Blender (on 3 accounts) is ray-tracing, where the developer has free control on where light-rays point.
                Once the final ray path is calculated, they can sample a <a target="_blank" src="https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Cubemap_Texture">cubemap texture</a>.
                Typically, the light ray bends smoothly/ continuously near the blackhole and such backwards ray-tracing implementations acknowledge that and bend the ray
                multiple times. Unfortunately, this is only available in cycles rendering mode and we also would like our implementation to be REALTIME.
                <br><br>
                For gravitational-lensing to be done in realtime, we'll use the Eevee rendering engine and bend light only once towards a correct final path.
                <br><br>
                To do this, we enable Screen Space refractions in our visual settings.<br><br>
                <img src="img/ssr.png" style="width: 42%;">
                <img src="img/ssr2.png" style="width: 35%;">
                <br><br>
                
                Now to perform refractions, a 'Refraction BSDF' shader must be used which performs the ray-bounce calculations internally.
                When light hits the object is bent near/away the normal depending on the Index of Refraction ratio between both mediums the light travels through.
                <br><br>
                <img src="https://lateasusual.com/b/_images/ssr_refraction_photo.png" style="width: 35%;">
                <br><br>
                We can use ANY geometry to perform this; a plane could be used as a post-processing filter or a cube or any mesh (as long as we customize the normals appropriately).
                However, for this implementation we don't want to worry about staging or camera angles affecting the visual effect.
                So, what looks the same from all (euclidean) directions? A sphere. The normals on the sphere may also be customized quite easily.
                <br><br>
                <img src="img/sphere.png" style="width: 40%;">
                <br><br>
                Unfortunately, the spheres normals are set up so that the sides will have the most refraction.
                This is because the normals are at a large angle to the incoming vector (vector from our viewport to geometry).
                Whereas, the normal of the sphere pointing towards us is at a very low angle with the incoming vector.
                We want to flip that, with an IOR&#60;1 we can angle the normals like mirrors which point in the desired direction.
                The idea can roughly be described like:
                <br><br>
                <img src="img/light.png" style="width: 30%;">
                <img src="img/refract.png" style="width: 30%;">
                <br><br>
                This can be done by rotating each exisiting normal on the sphere by 90 degrees inwards to the center. 
                For this, we'll use axis-angle rotation where the axis is the vector perpendicular to the existing normal and the normal at the center which we want to rotate towards.
                Thus to get the axis, we only need a cross product of these two vectors followed by a normalize operation.
                For the vector we rotate, we want it in camera space - because the normals we construct all dependent on the camera angled as it is.
                <br><br>
                <img src="img/n1.png" style="width: 60%;">
                <img src="img/ex1.png" style="width: 30%;">
                <br><br>
                Next, well add some customization for how much light gets bent by manipulating the IOR.
                A fairly helpful calculation is the angle from the incoming vector. 
                This can be obtained with a dot product, followed by an arccosine function.
                Next with map the range [0, pi/2 (90deg)] to [0, 1] and apply a float curve, followed by an additional map range to the units of our desired IOR.
                The lower 'To min' parameter is customizable - although at some point the refracted angle becomes too steep and an inner circle forms; this param changes the radius of that.
                Notice below, how the edge of the sphere is now softer with the calculted IOR.
                <br><br>
                <img src="img/n2.png" style="width: 60%;">
                <img src="img/ex2.png" style="width: 30%;">
                <br><br>
                Finally, we add DARKNESS. A simple way of doing this is using the previously calculated angle to determine the distance of a pixel from the center of the circle by using a arctan function.
                This is a ratio of [0,1] where 0 = center and 1 = edge. Passed through a less-than functions gives a mask which can be used to mix the refraction shader with a black-diffuse or black-emission shader.
                <br><br>
                <img src="img/n3.png" style="width: 60%;">
                <img src="img/ex3.png" style="width: 30%;">
                <br><br>
                <h2 id="disk">Accretion Disk</h2>
                The accretion disk is simply a disk with a procedural texture on it.
                The first step is to create a rotated space around the center (left) of the sphere (middle). 
                Then pass in those coordinates to a noise function and masking out high values (right).
                <br><br>
                <img src="img/acc1.png" style="width: 30%;">
                <img src="img/acc2.png" style="width: 30%;">
                <img src="img/acc3.png" style="width: 30%;">
                <img src="img/n4.png" style="width: 90%;">
                <br><br>
                Notice, how scene time is used to offset the angle to rotate at so that over time the disk spins.
                However, we want the inner disk to spin faster than the outer disk (for physical accuracy).
                To do this we must chop up the disk into various layers or rings (like a tree-trunk). 
                If this was continuous the noise would just get super stretched as it goes inwards. We don't want this.
                <br><br>
                So we'll spin the rings in the center faster (multiply scene time by large value). Here I made a nodegroup,
                to abstract the complex spinning logic seperately.<br><br>
                <img src="img/acc4.png" style="width: 30%;">
                <img src="img/acc5.png" style="width: 30%;">
                <img src="img/acc6.png" style="width: 30%;">
                <img src="img/n5.png" style="width: 90%;">
                <br><br>
                Unfortunately, by discretizing the disks- it will look choppy and people will know just what we did there (escpecially when its moving).<br><br>
                <img src="img/acc7.png" style="width: 90%;">
                <br><br>
                The fix? Blend. A simple method is to create multiple segments where rings overlap. 
                This can be done in so many ways, and theres a smart way where you could offset to layers splitting and perform a soft less than
                so that the edges of each ring fade off slowly while the same coverage is maintained.
                Here, I just overlayed to layers and performed a smooth mimimum on the two.
                <br><br>
                <img src="img/acc8.png" style="width: 90%;">
                <br><br>
                Next we add color. There are also many ways to do this - but the scene is very simple shape wise. 
                I find that when the shapes are simple, simple color schemes pair well. 
                Specially, we'll push this as far as it can go by employing pure red (255,0,0) against black (0,0,0).
                <br><br>
                These colors have a HUGE contrast, which would not be as bold if you sampled various colors. Less = More.
                If you want to see something truly amazing google 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=red+anime&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS817US817&sxsrf=ALiCzsbrtPvJ_JzW6iRE8s26Arpph7X2kg:1653278121959&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiairL53PT3AhVDO30KHUn4B8gQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=1280&bih=605&dpr=2">red anime</a>.
                Notice, how many people have some to the same conclusion on this red-black color scheme.
                Here, I drew this from Evangelion which I'd say mastered the color red in their cels.<br><br>
                <img src="img/acc9.png" style="width: 90%;">
                <br><br>
                Next, we'll add a bit extra on the edges before passing this through the comparison operation.
                <br><br>
                <img src="img/acc10.png" style="width: 90%;">
                <img src="img/n6.png" style="width: 90%;">
                <br><br>
                Finally, its a tad violent at the center since stuff is spinning so fast. So, lets shift aroud the noise in the center.
                This will change the coordinates we used at the start and use a simple noise texture to offset the center.<br><br>
                <img src="img/n7.png" style="width: 90%;">

                Where this fails, is that the disk doesn't have volume along the Z axis. 
                To fake this, you create a few layers of disks to add depth and in this situation I employed the technique from
